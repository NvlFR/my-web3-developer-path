![Ethereum Banner]([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/dev/public/images/heroes/enterprise-hero.png](https://ethereum.org/_next/image/?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fhero.94a1ecc4.png&w=1504&q=75))

## 🎯 Mission

This repository documents my personal journey to become a professional Smart Contract Developer. It serves as a living portfolio of my progress, containing all the code, projects, and notes from my structured learning path under the guidance of my mentor. My goal is to master Solidity, understand security best practices, and become a job-ready Web3 developer.
